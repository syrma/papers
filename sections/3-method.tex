\section{Method}

Policy Gradients tend to have a high-variance, needing sometimes an unreasonable amount of samples in order to converge. The attempts to improve sample efficiency in PG methods have mostly consisted of developing increasingly complex methods, which in turn makes replicating results hard if not nearly impossible, thus slowing down research and limiting the potential use of these methods in real-life applications.

Ensemble techniques have been used (insert ref)
